# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
---------------------------------------------------                                 
A program implemented in JavaFX is created to be an easily extendable program for visualizing various algorithms.                           
The program was developed using object-oriented techniques for maximizing code reuse.                                                           
Some of the implemented Algorithms:                         
>Bubble-Sort              
>Selection-Sort               
>Insertion-Sort
